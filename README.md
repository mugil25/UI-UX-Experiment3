# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

To perform a heuristic evaluation and comparative analysis of the **Amazon.in** and **Flipkart** homepages, identify usability issues, and suggest improvements to enhance user experience.

---

## Algorithm:

1. **Select platforms** – Amazon.in and Flipkart websites (homepages).
2. **Apply Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics** to both platforms.
3. **Score each heuristic** (1 = poor → 5 = excellent).
4. **Identify issues and opportunities** in UI/UX design for each platform.
5. **Perform competitor comparison** to highlight strengths and weaknesses.
6. **Suggest improvements** for usability, accessibility, and visual design.
7. **Summarize findings** in terms of heuristic averages and actionable recommendations.

**Average Score** → Amazon: 3.1 | Flipkart: 3.5

### Key Observations

* **Amazon.in**: Strong brand presence, powerful search, but suffers from cluttered header, oversized hero carousel, and accessibility contrast issues.
* **Flipkart**: Cleaner navigation with slightly more consistency, better product tile density, but sometimes overly cluttered with offers.

### Recommended Changes

* **Amazon.in**: Reduce header height, improve contrast, make search more prominent, restructure carousel to highlight product tiles.
* **Flipkart**: Simplify promotional clutter, emphasize accessibility with better contrast, refine category icons.

---

## Result:

The heuristic evaluation shows that **Flipkart scores slightly higher than Amazon.in** in usability and consistency. However, both platforms can improve accessibility, minimalism, and help/documentation visibility. Implementing the suggested changes will enhance user navigation, discoverability, and trust, leading to a better overall user experience.
